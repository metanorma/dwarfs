## Overview

![Alt text](doc/screenshot.gif?raw=true "DwarFS Screenshot")

DwarFS is a read-only file system with a focus on achieving **very
high compression ratios** in particular for very redundant data.

This probably doesn't sound very exciting, because if it's redundant,
it *should* compress well. However, I found that other read-only,
compressed file systems don't do a very good job at making use of
this redundancy. See [here](#comparison) for a comparison with other
compressed file systems.

DwarFS also **doesn't compromise on speed** and for my use cases I've
found it to be on par with or perform better than SquashFS. For my
primary use case, **DwarFS compression is an order of magnitude better
than SquashFS compression**, it's **6 times faster to build the file
system**, it's typically faster to access files on DwarFS and it uses
less CPU resources.

Distinct features of DwarFS are:

* Clustering of files by similarity using a similarity hash function.
  This makes it easier to exploit the redundancy across file boundaries.

* Segmentation analysis across file system blocks in order to reduce
  the size of the uncompressed file system. This saves memory when
  using the compressed file system and thus potentially allows for
  higher cache hit rates as more data can be kept in the cache.

* Highly multi-threaded implementation. Both the file
  [system creation tool](doc/mkdwarfs.md) as well as the
  [FUSE driver](doc/dwarfs.md) are able to make good use of the
  many cores of your system.

* Optional experimental Python scripting support to provide custom
  filtering and ordering functionality.

## History

I started working on DwarFS in 2013 and my main use case and major
motivation was that I had several hundred different versions of Perl
that were taking up something around 30 gigabytes of disk space, and
I was unwilling to spend more than 10% of my hard drive keeping them
around for when I happened to need them.

Up until then, I had been using [Cromfs](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/cromfs.html)
for squeezing them into a manageable size. However, I was getting more
and more annoyed by the time it took to build the filesystem image
and, to make things worse, more often than not it was crashing after
about an hour or so.

I had obviously also looked into [SquashFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS),
but never got anywhere close to the compression rates of Cromfs.

This alone wouldn't have been enough to get me into writing DwarFS,
but at around the same time, I was pretty obsessed with the recent
developments and features of newer C++ standards and really wanted
a C++ hobby project to work on. Also, I've wanted to do something
with [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)
for quite some time. Last but not least, I had been thinking about
the problem of compressed file systems for a bit and had some ideas
that I definitely wanted to try.

The majority of the code was written in 2013, then I did a couple
of cleanups, bugfixes and refactors every once in a while, but I
never really got it to a state where I would feel happy releasing
it. It was too awkward to build with its dependency on Facebook's
(quite awesome) [folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) library
and it didn't have any documentation.

Digging out the project again this year, things didn't look as grim
as they used to. Folly now builds with CMake and so I just pulled
it in as a submodule. Most other dependencies can be satisfied
from packages that should be widely available. And I've written
some rudimentary docs as well.

## Building and Installing

### Dependencies

DwarFS uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a build tool.

It uses both [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) and
[Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly), though the latter is
included as a submodule since very few distributions actually
offer packages for it. Folly itself has a number of dependencies,
so please check [here](https://github.com/facebook/folly#dependencies)
for an up-to-date list.

It also uses [Facebook Thrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift),
in particular the `frozen` library, for storing metadata in a highly
space-efficient, memory-mappable and well defined format. It's also
included as a submodule, and we only build the compiler and a very
reduced library that contains just enough for DwarFS to work.

Other than that, DwarFS really only depends on FUSE3 and on a set
of compression libraries that Folly already depends on (namely
[lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4), [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
and [liblzma](https://github.com/kobolabs/liblzma)).

The dependency on [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
will be automatically resolved if you build with tests.

A good starting point for apt-based systems is probably:

    $ apt install \
        g++ \
        clang \
        cmake \
        make \
        bison \
        flex \
        ronn \
        fuse3 \
        pkg-config \
        binutils-dev \
        libarchive-dev \
        libboost-context-dev \
        libboost-filesystem-dev \
        libboost-program-options-dev \
        libboost-python-dev \
        libboost-regex-dev \
        libboost-system-dev \
        libboost-thread-dev \
        libevent-dev \
        libjemalloc-dev \
        libdouble-conversion-dev \
        libiberty-dev \
        liblz4-dev \
        liblzma-dev \
        libssl-dev \
        libunwind-dev \
        libdwarf-dev \
        libelf-dev \
        libfmt-dev \
        libfuse3-dev \
        libgoogle-glog-dev

Note that when building with `gcc`, the optimization level will be
set to `-O2` instead of the CMake default of `-O3` for release
builds. At least with versions up to `gcc-10`, the `-O3` build is
[up to 70% slower](https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs/issues/14) than a
build with `-O2`.


### Building

Firstly, either clone the repository...

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs
    $ cd dwarfs

...or unpack the release archive:

    $ tar xvf dwarfs-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    $ cd dwarfs-x.y.z

Once all dependencies have been installed, you can build DwarFS
using:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DWITH_TESTS=1
    $ make -j$(nproc)

You can then run tests with:

    $ make test

All binaries use [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc)
as a memory allocator by default, as it is typically uses much less
system memory compared to the `glibc` or `tcmalloc` allocators.
To disable the use of `jemalloc`, pass `-DUSE_JEMALLOC=0` on the
`cmake` command line.

### Installing

Installing is as easy as:

    $ sudo make install

Though you don't have to install the tools to play with them.

### Experimental Python Scripting Support

You can build `mkdwarfs` with experimental support for Python
scripting:

    $ cmake .. -DWITH_TESTS=1 -DWITH_PYTHON=1

This also requires Boost.Python. If you have multiple Python
versions installed, you can explicitly specify the version to
build against:

    $ cmake .. -DWITH_TESTS=1 -DWITH_PYTHON=1 -DWITH_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8

Note that only Python 3 is supported. You can take a look at
[scripts/example.py](scripts/example.py) to get an idea for
what can currently be done with the interface.

## Usage

Please check out the man pages for [mkdwarfs](doc/mkdwarfs.md),
[dwarfs](doc/dwarfs.md), [dwarfsck](doc/dwarfsck.md) and
[dwarfsextract](doc/dwarfsextract.md).

The [dwarfs](doc/dwarfs.md) man page also shows an example for setting
up DwarFS with [overlayfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt)
in order to create a writable file system mount on top a read-only
DwarFS image.

A description of the DwarFS filesystem format can be found in
[dwarfs-format](doc/dwarfs-format.md).

## Comparison

The SquashFS, `xz`, `lrzip`, `zpaq` and `wimlib` tests were all done on
an 8 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2286M CPU @ 2.40GHz with 64 GiB of RAM.

The Cromfs and EROFS tests were done with an older version of DwarFS
on a 6 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU D-1528 @ 1.90GHz with 64 GiB of RAM.

The systems were mostly idle during all of the tests.

### With SquashFS

The source directory contained **1139 different Perl installations**
from 284 distinct releases, a total of 47.65 GiB of data in 1,927,501
files and 330,733 directories. The source directory was freshly
unpacked from a tar archive to an XFS partition on a 970 EVO Plus 2TB
NVME drive, so most of its contents were likely cached.

I'm using the same compression type and compression level for
SquashFS that is the default setting for DwarFS:

    $ time mksquashfs install perl-install.squashfs -comp zstd -Xcompression-level 22

    sys     1m47.968s

So in this comparison, `mkdwarfs` is **more than 6 times faster** than `mksquashfs`,
both in terms of CPU time and wall clock time.

    $ ll perl-install.*fs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  447230618 Mar  3 20:28 perl-install.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 4748902400 Mar  3 20:10 perl-install.squashfs

In terms of compression ratio, the **DwarFS file system is more than 10 times
smaller than the SquashFS file system**. With DwarFS, the content has been
**compressed down to less than 0.9% (!) of its original size**. This compression
ratio only considers the data stored in the individual files, not the actual
disk space used. On the original XFS file system, according to `du`, the
source folder uses 52 GiB, so **the DwarFS image actually only uses 0.8% of
the original space**.

Here's another comparison using `lzma` compression instead of `zstd`:

    $ time mksquashfs install perl-install-lzma.squashfs -comp lzma

    real    13m42.825s
    user    205m40.851s
    sys     3m29.088s

    $ time mkdwarfs -i install -o perl-install-lzma.dwarfs -l9

    real    3m43.937s
    user    49m45.295s
    sys     1m44.550s

    $ ll perl-install-lzma.*fs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  315482627 Mar  3 21:23 perl-install-lzma.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 3838406656 Mar  3 20:50 perl-install-lzma.squashfs

It's immediately obvious that the runs are significantly faster and the
resulting images are significantly smaller. Still, `mkdwarfs` is about
**4 times faster** and produces and image that's **12 times smaller** than
the SquashFS image. The DwarFS image is only 0.6% of the original file size.

So why not use `lzma` instead of `zstd` by default? The reason is that `lzma`
is about an order of magnitude slower to decompress than `zstd`. If you're
only accessing data on your compressed filesystem occasionally, this might
not be a big deal, but if you use it extensively, `zstd` will result in
better performance.

The comparisons above are not completely fair. `mksquashfs` by default
uses a block size of 128KiB, whereas `mkdwarfs` uses 16MiB blocks by default,
or even 64MiB blocks with `-l9`. When using identical block sizes for both
file systems, the difference, quite expectedly, becomes a lot less dramatic:

    $ time mksquashfs install perl-install-lzma-1M.squashfs -comp lzma -b 1M

    real    15m43.319s
    user    139m24.533s
    sys     0m45.132s

    $ time mkdwarfs -i install -o perl-install-lzma-1M.dwarfs -l9 -S20 -B3

    real    4m25.973s
    user    52m15.100s
    sys     7m41.889s

    $ ll perl-install*.*fs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  935953866 Mar 13 12:12 perl-install-lzma-1M.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 3407474688 Mar  3 21:54 perl-install-lzma-1M.squashfs

Even this is *still* not entirely fair, as it uses a feature (`-B3`) that allows
DwarFS to reference file chunks from up to two previous filesystem blocks.

But the point is that this is really where SquashFS tops out, as it doesn't
support larger block sizes or back-referencing. And as you'll see below, the
larger blocks that DwarFS is using by default don't necessarily negatively
impact performance.

DwarFS also features an option to recompress an existing file system with
a different compression algorithm. This can be useful as it allows relatively
fast experimentation with different algorithms and options without requiring
a full rebuild of the file system. For example, recompressing the above file
system with the best possible compression (`-l 9`):

    $ time mkdwarfs --recompress -i perl-install.dwarfs -o perl-lzma-re.dwarfs -l9
    I 20:28:03.246534 filesystem rewrittenwithout errors [148.3s]

    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 315482627 Mar  3 21:23 perl-install-lzma.dwarfs

Note that while the recompressed filesystem is smaller than the original image,
it is still a lot bigger than the filesystem we previously build with `-l9`.
The reason is that the recompressed image still uses the same block size, and
the block size cannot be changed by recompressing.

In terms of how fast the file system is when using it, a quick test
I've done is to freshly mount the filesystem created above and run
each of the 1139 `perl` executables to print their version.

    $ hyperfine -c "umount mnt" -p "umount mnt; dwarfs perl-install.dwarfs mnt -o cachesize=1g -o workers=4; sleep 1" -P procs 5 20 -D 5 "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P{procs} sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'"

      Time (mean ± σ):      1.333 s ±  0.009 s    [User: 1.993 s, System: 0.656 s]

      Range (min … max):    1.136 s …  1.186 s    10 runs

These timings are for *initial* runs on a freshly mounted file system,
running 5, 10, 15 and 20 processes in parallel. 1.1 seconds means that
it takes only about 1 millisecond per Perl binary.

Following are timings for *subsequent* runs, both on DwarFS (at `mnt`)
and the original XFS (at `install`). DwarFS is around 15% slower here:

Using the lzma-compressed file system, the metrics for *initial* runs look
considerably worse (about an order of magnitude):

    $ hyperfine -c "umount mnt" -p "umount mnt; dwarfs perl-install-lzma.dwarfs mnt -o cachesize=1g -o workers=4; sleep 1" -P procs 5 20 -D 5 "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P{procs} sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'"

So you might want to consider using `zstd` instead of `lzma` if you'd
like to optimize for file system performance. It's also the default
compression used by `mkdwarfs`.

Now here's a comparison with the SquashFS filesystem:

    $ hyperfine -c 'sudo umount mnt' -p 'umount mnt; dwarfs perl-install.dwarfs mnt -o cachesize=1g -o workers=4; sleep 1' -n dwarfs-zstd "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P20 sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'" -p 'sudo umount mnt; sudo mount -t squashfs perl-install.squashfs mnt; sleep 1' -n squashfs-zstd "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P20 sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'"
    Benchmark #1: dwarfs-zstd
      Time (mean ± σ):      1.151 s ±  0.015 s    [User: 2.147 s, System: 0.769 s]
      Range (min … max):    1.118 s …  1.174 s    10 runs

    Benchmark #2: squashfs-zstd
      Time (mean ± σ):      6.733 s ±  0.007 s    [User: 3.188 s, System: 17.015 s]
      Range (min … max):    6.721 s …  6.743 s    10 runs

    Summary
      'dwarfs-zstd' ran
        5.85 ± 0.08 times faster than 'squashfs-zstd'

So DwarFS is almost six times faster than SquashFS. But what's more,
SquashFS also uses significantly more CPU power. However, the numbers
shown above for DwarFS obviously don't include the time spent in the
`dwarfs` process, so I repeated the test outside of hyperfine:

    $ time dwarfs perl-install.dwarfs mnt -o cachesize=1g -o workers=4 -f

    real    0m4.569s
    user    0m2.154s
    sys     0m1.846s

So in total, DwarFS was using 5.7 seconds of CPU time, whereas
SquashFS was using 20.2 seconds, almost four times as much. Ignore
the 'real' time, this is only how long it took me to unmount the
file system again after mounting it.

Another real-life test was to build and test a Perl module with 624
different Perl versions in the compressed file system. The module I've
used, [Tie::Hash::Indexed](https://github.com/mhx/Tie-Hash-Indexed),
has an XS component that requires a C compiler to build. So this really
accesses a lot of different stuff in the file system:

* The `perl` executables and its shared libraries

* The Perl modules used for writing the Makefile

* Perl's C header files used for building the module

* More Perl modules used for running the tests

I wrote a little script to be able to run multiple builds in parallel:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -eu
perl=$1
dir=$(echo "$perl" | cut -d/ --output-delimiter=- -f5,6)
rsync -a Tie-Hash-Indexed/ $dir/
cd $dir
$1 Makefile.PL >/dev/null 2>&1
make test >/dev/null 2>&1
cd ..
rm -rf $dir
echo $perl
```

The following command will run up to 16 builds in parallel on the 8 core
Xeon CPU, including debug, optimized and threaded versions of all Perl
releases between 5.10.0 and 5.33.3, a total of 624 `perl` installations:

    $ time ls -1 /tmp/perl/install/*/perl-5.??.?/bin/perl5* | sort -t / -k 8 | xargs -d $'\n' -P 16 -n 1 ./build.sh

Tests were done with a cleanly mounted file system to make sure the caches
were empty. `ccache` was primed to make sure all compiler runs could be
satisfied from the cache. With SquashFS, the timing was:

    real    0m52.385s
    user    8m10.333s
    sys     4m10.056s

And with DwarFS:

    real    0m50.469s
    user    9m22.597s
    sys     1m18.469s

So, frankly, not much of a difference, with DwarFS being just a bit faster.
The `dwarfs` process itself used:

    real    0m56.686s
    user    0m18.857s
    sys     0m21.058s

So again, DwarFS used less raw CPU power overall, but in terms of wallclock
time, the difference is really marginal.

### With SquashFS & xz

This test uses slightly less pathological input data: the root filesystem of
a recent Raspberry Pi OS release. This file system also contains device inodes,
so in order to preserve those, we pass `--with-devices` to `mkdwarfs`:

    $ time sudo mksquashfs raspbian raspbian.squashfs -comp zstd -Xcompression-level 22

    real    0m50.124s
    user    9m41.708s
    sys     0m1.727s

The difference in speed is almost negligible. SquashFS is just a bit
slower here. In terms of compression, the difference also isn't huge:

    $ ls -lh raspbian.* *.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx  users 297M Mar  4 21:32 2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  287M Mar  4 21:31 raspbian.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  364M Mar  4 21:33 raspbian.squashfs

Interestingly, `xz` actually can't compress the whole original image
better than DwarFS.

We can even again try to increase the DwarFS compression level:

    $ time sudo mkdwarfs -i raspbian -o raspbian-9.dwarfs --with-devices -l9

    real    0m54.161s
    user    8m40.109s
    sys     0m7.101s

Now that actually gets the DwarFS image size well below that of the
`xz` archive:

    $ ls -lh raspbian-9.dwarfs *.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  244M Mar  4 21:36 raspbian-9.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx  users 297M Mar  4 21:32 2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img.xz

Even if you actually build a tarball and compress that (instead of
compressing the EXT4 file system itself), `xz` isn't quite able to
match the DwarFS image size:

    $ time sudo tar cf - raspbian | xz -9 -vT 0 >raspbian.tar.xz
      100 %     246.9 MiB / 1,037.2 MiB = 0.238    13 MiB/s       1:18

    real    1m18.226s
    user    6m35.381s
    sys     0m2.205s

    $ ls -lh raspbian.tar.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 247M Mar  4 21:40 raspbian.tar.xz

DwarFS also comes with the [dwarfsextract](doc/dwarfsextract.md) tool
that allows extraction of a filesystem image without the FUSE driver.
So here's a comparison of the extraction speed:

    $ time sudo tar xf raspbian.tar.xz -C out1

    real    0m12.846s
    user    0m12.313s
    sys     0m1.616s

    $ time sudo dwarfsextract -i raspbian-9.dwarfs -o out2

    real    0m3.825s
    user    0m13.234s
    sys     0m1.382s

So `dwarfsextract` is almost 4 times faster thanks to using multiple
worker threads for decompression. It's writing about 300 MiB/s in this
example.

Another nice feature of `dwarfsextract` is that it allows you to directly
output data in an archive format, so you could create a tarball from
your image without extracting the files to disk:

    $ dwarfsextract -i raspbian-9.dwarfs -f ustar | xz -9 -T0 >raspbian2.tar.xz

This has the interesting side-effect that the resulting tarball will
likely be smaller than the one built straight from the directory:

    $ ls -lh raspbian*.tar.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 247M Mar  4 21:40 raspbian.tar.xz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 240M Mar  4 23:52 raspbian2.tar.xz

That's because `dwarfsextract` writes files in inode-order, and by
default inodes are ordered by similarity for the best possible
compression.

### With lrzip

[lrzip](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip) is a compression utility
targeted especially at compressing large files. From its description,
it looks like it does something very similar to DwarFS, i.e. it looks
for duplicate segments before passsing the de-duplicated data on to
an `lzma` compressor.

When I first read about `lrzip`, I was pretty certain it would easily
beat DwarFS. So let's take a look. `lrzip` operates on a single file,
so it's necessary to first build a tarball:

    $ time tar cf perl-install.tar install

    real    2m9.568s
    user    0m3.757s
    sys     0m26.623s

Now we can run `lrzip`:

    $ time lrzip -vL9 -o perl-install.tar.lrzip perl-install.tar
    The following options are in effect for this COMPRESSION.
    Threading is ENABLED. Number of CPUs detected: 16
    Detected 67106172928 bytes ram

    perl-install.tar - Compression Ratio: 100.378. Average Compression Speed: 14.536MB/s.
    Total time: 00:57:32.47

    real    57m32.472s
    user    81m44.104s
    sys     4m50.221s

That definitely took a while. This is about an order of magnitude
slower than `mkdwarfs` and it barely makes use of the 8 cores.

    $ ll -h perl-install.tar.lrzip
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 500M Mar  6 21:16 perl-install.tar.lrzip

This is a surprisingly disappointing result. The archive is 65% larger
than a DwarFS image at `-l9` that takes less than 4 minutes to build.
Also, you can't just access the files in the `.lrzip` without fully
unpacking the archive first.

That being said, it *is* better than just using `xz` on the tarball:

    $ time xz -T0 -v9 -c perl-install.tar >perl-install.tar.xz
    perl-install.tar (1/1)
      100 %      4,317.0 MiB / 49.0 GiB = 0.086    24 MiB/s      34:55

    real    34m55.450s
    user    543m50.810s
    sys     0m26.533s

    $ ll perl-install.tar.xz -h
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 4.3G Mar  6 22:59 perl-install.tar.xz

### With zpaq

[zpaq](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html) is a journaling backup
utility and archiver. Again, it appears to share some of the ideas in
DwarFS, like segmentation analysis, but it also adds some features on
top that make it useful for incremental backups. However, it's also
not usable as a file system, so data needs to be extracted before it
can be used.

Anyway, how does it fare in terms of speed and compression performance?

    $ time zpaq a perl-install.zpaq install -m5

After a few million lines of output that (I think) cannot be turned off:

    2258234 +added, 0 -removed.

    0.000000 + (51161.953159 -> 8932.000297 -> 490.227707) = 490.227707 MB
    2828.082 seconds (all OK)

    real    47m8.104s
    user    714m44.286s
    sys     3m6.751s

So it's an order of magnitude slower than `mkdwarfs` and uses 14 times
as much CPU resources as `mkdwarfs -l9`. The resulting archive it pretty
close in size to the default configuration DwarFS image, but it's more
than 50% bigger than the image produced by `mkdwarfs -l9`.

    $ ll perl-install*.*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 490227707 Mar  7 01:38 perl-install.zpaq
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 315482627 Mar  3 21:23 perl-install-l9.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 447230618 Mar  3 20:28 perl-install.dwarfs

What's *really* surprising is how slow it is to extract the `zpaq`
archive again:

    $ time zpaq x perl-install.zpaq
    2798.097 seconds (all OK)

    real    46m38.117s
    user    711m18.734s
    sys     3m47.876s

That's 700 times slower than extracting the DwarFS image.


### With wimlib

[wimlib](https://wimlib.net/) is a really interesting project that is
a lot more mature than DwarFS. While DwarFS at its core has a library
component that could potentially be ported to other operating systems,
wimlib already is available on many platforms. It also seems to have
quite a rich set of features, so it's definitely worth taking a look at.

I first tried `wimcapture` on the perl dataset:

    $ time wimcapture --unix-data --solid --solid-chunk-size=16M install perl-install.wim
    Scanning "install"
    47 GiB scanned (1927501 files, 330733 directories)
    Using LZMS compression with 16 threads
    Archiving file data: 19 GiB of 19 GiB (100%) done

    real    15m23.310s
    user    174m29.274s
    sys     0m42.921s

    $ ll perl-install.*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  447230618 Mar  3 20:28 perl-install.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  315482627 Mar  3 21:23 perl-install-l9.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 4748902400 Mar  3 20:10 perl-install.squashfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 1016981520 Mar  6 21:12 perl-install.wim

So wimlib is definitely much better than squashfs, in terms of both
compression ratio and speed. DwarFS is however about 3 times faster to
create the file system and the DwarFS file system less than half the size.
When switching to LZMA compression, the DwarFS file system is more than
3 times smaller (wimlib uses LZMS compression by default).

What's a bit surprising is that mounting a *wim* file takes quite a bit
of time:

    $ time wimmount perl-install.wim mnt
    [WARNING] Mounting a WIM file containing solid-compressed data; file access may be slow.

    real    0m2.038s
    user    0m1.764s
    sys     0m0.242s

Mounting the DwarFS image takes almost no time in comparison:

    $ time git/github/dwarfs/build-clang-11/dwarfs perl-install-default.dwarfs mnt
    I 00:23:39.238182 dwarfs (v0.4.0, fuse version 35)

    real    0m0.003s
    user    0m0.003s
    sys     0m0.000s

That's just because it immediately forks into background by default and
initializes the file system in the background. However, even when
running it in the foreground, initializing the file system takes only
about 60 milliseconds:

    $ dwarfs perl-install.dwarfs mnt -f
    I 00:25:03.186005 dwarfs (v0.4.0, fuse version 35)
    I 00:25:03.248061 file system initialized [60.95ms]

If you actually build the DwarFS file system with uncompressed metadata,
mounting is basically instantaneous:

    $ dwarfs perl-install-meta.dwarfs mnt -f
    I 00:27:52.667026 dwarfs (v0.4.0, fuse version 35)
    I 00:27:52.671066 file system initialized [2.879ms]

I've tried running the benchmark where all 1139 `perl` executables
print their version with the wimlib image, but after about 10 minutes,
it still hadn't finished the first run (with the DwarFS image, one run
took slightly more than 2 seconds). I then tried the following instead:

    $ ls -1 /tmp/perl/install/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P1 sh -c 'time $0 -v >/dev/null' 2>&1 | grep ^real
    real    0m0.802s
    real    0m0.652s
    real    0m1.677s
    real    0m1.973s
    real    0m1.435s
    real    0m1.879s
    real    0m2.003s
    real    0m1.695s
    real    0m2.343s
    real    0m1.899s
    real    0m1.809s
    real    0m1.790s
    real    0m2.115s

Judging from that, it would have probably taken about half an hour
for a single run, which makes at least the `--solid` wim image pretty
much unusable for actually working with the file system.

The `--solid` option was suggested to me because it resembles the way
that DwarFS actually organizes data internally. However, judging by the
warning when mounting a solid image, it's probably not ideal when using
the image as a mounted file system. So I tried again without `--solid`:

    $ time wimcapture --unix-data install perl-install-nonsolid.wim
    Scanning "install"
    47 GiB scanned (1927501 files, 330733 directories)
    Using LZX compression with 16 threads
    Archiving file data: 19 GiB of 19 GiB (100%) done

    real    8m39.034s
    user    64m58.575s
    sys     0m32.003s

This is still more than 3 minutes slower than `mkdwarfs`. However, it
yields an image that's almost 10 times the size of the DwarFS image
and comparable in size to the SquashFS image:

    $ ll perl-install-nonsolid.wim -h
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 4.6G Mar  6 23:24 perl-install-nonsolid.wim

This *still* takes surprisingly long to mount:

    $ time wimmount perl-install-nonsolid.wim mnt

    real    0m1.603s
    user    0m1.327s
    sys     0m0.275s

However, it's really usable as a file system, even though it's about
4-5 times slower than the DwarFS image:

    $ hyperfine -c 'umount mnt' -p 'umount mnt; dwarfs perl-install.dwarfs mnt -o cachesize=1g -o workers=4; sleep 1' -n dwarfs "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P20 sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'" -p 'umount mnt; wimmount perl-install-nonsolid.wim mnt; sleep 1' -n wimlib "ls -1 mnt/*/*/bin/perl5* | xargs -d $'\n' -n1 -P20 sh -c '\$0 -v >/dev/null'"
    Benchmark #1: dwarfs

### With Cromfs

I used [Cromfs](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/cromfs.html) in the past
for compressed file systems and remember that it did a pretty good job
in terms of compression ratio. But it was never fast. However, I didn't
quite remember just *how* slow it was until I tried to set up a test.

Here's a run on the Perl dataset, with the block size set to 16 MiB to
match the default of DwarFS, and with additional options suggested to
speed up compression:

    $ time mkcromfs -f 16777216 -qq -e -r100000 install perl-install.cromfs
    Writing perl-install.cromfs...
    mkcromfs: Automatically enabling --24bitblocknums because it seems possible for this filesystem.

    Beginning task for Files and directories: Blockifying

    Termination signalled, cleaning up temporaries

    real    29m9.634s
    user    201m37.816s
    sys     2m15.005s

So it processed 21 MiB out of 48 GiB in half an hour, using almost
twice as much CPU resources as DwarFS for the *whole* file system.
At this point I decided it's likely not worth waiting (presumably)
another month (!) for `mkcromfs` to finish. I double checked that
I didn't accidentally build a debugging version, `mkcromfs` was
definitely built with `-O3`.

I then tried once more with a smaller version of the Perl dataset.
This only has 20 versions (instead of 1139) of Perl, and obviously
a lot less redundancy:

    $ time mkcromfs -f 16777216 -qq -e -r100000 install-small perl-install.cromfs
    Writing perl-install.cromfs...

So `mkdwarfs` is about 50 times faster than `mkcromfs` and uses 75 times
less CPU resources. At the same time, the DwarFS file system is 30% smaller:

    $ ls -l perl-install-small.*fs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 35328512 Dec  8 14:25 perl-install-small.cromfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 25175016 Dec 10 21:14 perl-install-small.dwarfs

I noticed that the `blockifying` step that took ages for the full dataset
with `mkcromfs` ran substantially faster (in terms of MiB/second) on the
smaller dataset, which makes me wonder if there's some quadratic complexity
behaviour that's slowing down `mkcromfs`.

In order to be completely fair, I also ran `mkdwarfs` with `-l 9` to enable
LZMA compression (which is what `mkcromfs` uses by default):

    $ time mkdwarfs -i install-small -o perl-install-small-l9.dwarfs -l 9

It takes about 15 seconds longer to build the DwarFS file system with LZMA
compression (this is still 35 times faster than Cromfs), but reduces the
size even further to make it almost half the size of the Cromfs file system.

I would have added some benchmarks with the Cromfs FUSE driver, but sadly
it crashed right upon trying to list the directory after mounting.

### With EROFS

[EROFS](https://github.com/hsiangkao/erofs-utils) is a new read-only
compressed file system that has recently been added to the Linux kernel.
Its goals are quite different from those of DwarFS, though. It is
designed to be lightweight (which DwarFS is definitely not) and to run
on constrained hardware like embedded devices or smartphones. It only
supports LZ4 compression.

I was feeling lucky and decided to run it on the full Perl dataset:

    $ time mkfs.erofs perl-install.erofs install -zlz4hc,9 -d2
    mkfs.erofs 1.2
            c_version:           [     1.2]
            c_dbg_lvl:           [       2]
            c_dry_run:           [       0]
    ^C

    real    912m42.601s
    user    903m2.777s
    sys     1m52.812s

As you can tell, after more than 15 hours I just gave up. In those
15 hours, `mkfs.erofs` had produced a 13 GiB output file:

    $ ll -h perl-install.erofs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 13G Dec  9 14:42 perl-install.erofs

I don't think this would have been very useful to compare with DwarFS.

Just as for Cromfs, I re-ran with the smaller Perl dataset:

    $ time mkfs.erofs perl-install-small.erofs install-small -zlz4hc,9 -d2
    mkfs.erofs 1.2
            c_version:           [     1.2]
            c_dbg_lvl:           [       2]
            c_dry_run:           [       0]

    real    0m27.844s
    user    0m20.570s
    sys     0m1.848s

That was surprisingly quick, which makes me think that, again, there
might be some accidentally quadratic complexity hiding in `mkfs.erofs`.
The output file it produced is an order of magnitude larger than the
DwarFS image:

    $ ls -l perl-install-small.*fs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users  26928161 Dec  8 15:05 perl-install-small.dwarfs
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mhx users 296488960 Dec  9 14:45 perl-install-small.erofs

Admittedly, this isn't a fair comparison. EROFS has a fixed block size
of 4 KiB, and it uses LZ4 compression. If we tweak DwarFS to the same
parameters, we get:

    $ time mkdwarfs -i install-small -o perl-install-small-lz4.dwarfs -C lz4hc:level=9 -S 12

It finishes in less than half the time and produces an output image
that's half the size of the EROFS image.

I'm going to stop the comparison here, as it's pretty obvious that the
domains in which EROFS and DwarFS are being used have extremely little
overlap. DwarFS will likely never be able to run on embedded devices
and EROFS will likely never be able to achieve the compression ratios
of DwarFS.
